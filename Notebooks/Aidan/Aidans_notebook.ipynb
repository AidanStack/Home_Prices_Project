    "We are taking housing data from King's County, Washington. This data has approximately 20 thousand entries, with each row representing a home sale. The entires include the sale price of each home, as well as other features, such as Sqaure fottage of living area, overall condition, zipcode etc. \n",

    "We have been hired by a developer to find out what factors indicate that a home will sell for a large amount. They want to build single family homes like the ones in our dataset and need to know which attributes to focus on. The variables most associated with home price are those that are the most important for the developer to invest in. \n"
